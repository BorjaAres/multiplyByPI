# Multiply by PI Program

This program prompts the user to enter a number and multiplies it by the mathematical constant PI. It utilizes JavaScript to perform the calculation and display the result in the console.

## Instructions

1. When prompted, enter a number.
2. The program will multiply the entered number by PI and display the result in the console.

## Code Explanation

The program consists of the following components:

1. **User Input**: The user is prompted to enter a number using the `prompt` function. The entered value is converted to a floating-point number using `parseFloat` and stored in the `num` variable.
2. **Multiplication Function**: The `multiplyByPI` function is defined to perform the multiplication operation. It takes a number as a parameter and returns the product of the number and the mathematical constant PI (`Math.PI`).
3. **Multiplication Operation**: The `multiplyByPI` function is called with the `num` variable as an argument to initiate the multiplication process. The result is stored in a temporary variable but not used.
4. **Console Output**: The result of the multiplication operation is displayed in the console using `console.log(multiplyByPI(num))`. This line calls the `multiplyByPI` function with the `num` variable as an argument and logs the returned value.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed to suit your requirements. Enjoy multiplying by PI!
